# M0 evaluation (the actual gate)

> Moved verbatim from the README; this is the project's own suggestion-quality gate.

This is not a unit test — it's the design doc's kill criterion. Run:

```bash
vidura-report
```

against your real last-30-days Claude Code logs. Read the output.

**Pass:** the report surfaces ≥3 suggestions you judge genuinely
non-obvious — specifically, it should catch something like the
judge/executor split miss described in the project's design doc.

**Fail:** after 2-3 rounds of prompt iteration in `vidura/reflect.py`'s
`SYSTEM_PROMPT`, it still doesn't clear that bar. Per the design doc's
kill criterion: **stop here.** Do not proceed to M1 (SQLite, the
Watcher, the Swift shell). Diagnose whether the blocker is chunking
granularity (`vidura/chunk.py`'s `CHUNK_TARGET_CHARS`, design doc Open
Question #3) or the model floor (design doc Open Question #1) before
touching the prompt again.
